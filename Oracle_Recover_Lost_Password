How To Recover a Lost Password on Oracle 
1)	To recover a password in Oracle:
Login to the machine where Oracle is installed. Open a command prompt (with administrator privileges) and navigate to the <Oracle_Home>/bin folder. (navigating to the bin folder may not be needed in most cases, but has been added as a precautionary step). Execute the below commands.
sqlplus /nolog
SQL>conn / as sysdba
SQL>alter user Username identified by PASSWORD;

2)	To reset your Oracle database password, the process is a bit different. Your password file should be under <orahome>\database\PWD<SID>.ora. 

Delete it and run the Oracle password utility from the command prompt:
<Oracle_Home>\database>ORAPWD file=PWD<SID>.ora password={password} entries={however many}.
The <password> is your new sys password. After you log in as sys, you can change it and create new passwords for the system.
